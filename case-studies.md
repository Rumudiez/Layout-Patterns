These case studies focus on the websites AOL, MSN, and Yahoo. They heavily reference the evolution of web design to evaluate current design trends, and as such, the primary visual reference shown in each case study is an animation illustrating five major redesigns from each of the chosen websites over the past two decades. These animations can be directly compared and provide an accurate representation of each given snapshot.

So, why choose AOL, MSN, and Yahoo?

In my initial research and data collection, many older websites were developed too specifically for certain browsers at one point or another. Due to these “optimizations,” many web pages cannot be rendered consistently using modern HTML and CSS engines. Websites with larger and more varied audiences did a better job of adhering to progressive enhancement as a standard, though, so sites like AOL, MSN, and Yahoo resulted in much more reliable image sequences than, say, Adobe, which used Flash for its primary (and occasionally sole) content delivery system.

For my series of case studies, I found there were two discerning paths I could explore. The first was to sample websites of a specific genre and evaluate their evolutions – similar to the stop-motion films I had made previously. The other path was to take a larger sample of websites and compare their structures from a significantly older generation of web design to their current ones. I chose to remain in the same vein as my stop-motion films because it provided a better basis for competitor analysis and therefore trend discovery.

Finally, these websites represent large, if not entire, portions of their respective business. This means they have always been revenue driven and each iteration on design must be an honest attempt to bolster that metric. Usability, although a core driving component in these environments today, was a by-product of achieving better conversion rates and maintaining an existing user base.
