Layout design is a foundational part of designing and developing websites. It is typically a result of the wireframing process, in which designers conceptualize behaviors and user flows, but often goes into varying levels of refinement throughout visual design phases, e.g. being applied to an updated grid system and receiving stylistic treatment to aid with emphasis. It may seem like just one of the many mundane steps in creating a website or app, but do layout designs hold any merit in their own right, and if so, how can I quantify it or evaluate its effects on other properties of interactive design?

My answer is this: functionality is mutually dependent on layout and web design consists almost solely of a collection of archetypes based on this principle. This project presents a set of case studies as well as initial explorations into other groupings of sites to prove that any given website can be categorized by layout alone and its functionality and purpose will suit those of others in its grouping.

The most confirming piece of evidence supporting this is the reverse application of the sorting technique. If you group websites together by function alone (i.e. social media, news media, forum, etc), you'll notice the groupings form in the same way as if you categorized based on layout alone. My reason for not simply sorting by function, however, is that implementation and user flows are much more flexible than layout design, and tend to fluctuate significantly between even these similar websites. Staying within the base-level of layout patterns, I've been able to provide a consistent and accurate taxonomy of web design.

Most websites can be grouped into the following categories:
{: archetypes}

1. **Scroll**
2. **Grid**
3. **Legacy**
4. **Thread**
5. **Frame**
6. **Stadium**

These archetypes of web design can be extended by the components of each. As such:

1. **Mix**
  : Navigation bar
  : Navigation sidebar (usually on the left)
  : Endless feed
  : External sidebar

2. **Grid**
  : Navigation bar
  : Header bar
  : Content sidebars
  : Gridded content
  : Multi-column footer

3. **Legacy**
  : Combination navigation-header
  : Single column content
  : Usually no sidebars (functionally limited)

4. **Thread**
  : Header bar
  : Navigation bar
  : Highly paginated content

5. **Frame**
  : Highly hierarchical, embedded panes of content
  : Minimal site-level features
  : Toolbars

6. **Stadium**
  : Navigation bar
  : Large, central content
  : Compact sidebar navigation
  : External sidebar
  : Simple footer

This taxonomy provides a method of categorization for future layout patterns and a simple assessment of their most likely function, which is a positive indicator of their best suited purpose. For example, if we collect a group of sites with similar components and apply one of the groupings defined above, we can see that blogs are best suited to the Legacy layout pattern and social media networks make good use of a wide combination of components, as seen in the Mix pattern. Most relevant to my case studies, news media seem to be best fit by the Grid pattern.
