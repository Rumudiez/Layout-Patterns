title: The Rise of Layout Patterns

Layouts form the foundation of design on the web. Over time, they have evolved in tandem with content and web technologies to become more interactive and versatile. Generally speaking, all web services can be grouped by function – i.e. social media, news, forums, email – and within each group there is a dominant technique for the site layout. These dominant techniques form the basis of a growing library of layout patterns.

Layouts are often derived by a site’s content structure (information architecture) and interaction needs (active and passive engagement). We can reverse engineer layouts to extrapolate  functionality and content structure as a proofing method for most deliverables of user experience design, resulting in faster and more diverse ideation and testing.

Today’s layout patterns are responsive and largely homogenous but still developing. By watching the advancement of more established web services, especially online news, we can gain a perspective on the trends of development and speculate on improvements for younger services, like social media.
This project documents the rise of patterns in web layouts in order to better understand the design trajectories of new and existing front end web services.
