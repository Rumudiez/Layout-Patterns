Layout design is a foundational part of designing and developing websites. It is typically a result of the wireframing process, in which designers conceptualize behaviors and user flows, but often goes into varying levels of refinement throughout visual design phases, e.g. being applied to an updated grid system and receiving stylistic treatment to aid with emphasis. It may seem like just one of the many mundane steps in creating a website or app, but do layout designs hold any merit in their own right, and if so, how can I quantify it or evaluate its effects on other properties of interactive design?

My answer is this: functionality is mutually dependent on layout and web design consists almost solely of a collection of archetypes based on this principle. This project presents a set of case studies as well as initial explorations into other groupings of sites to prove that any given website can be categorized by layout alone and its functionality and purpose will suit those of others in its grouping.

The most confirming piece of evidence supporting this is the reverse application of the sorting technique. If you group websites together by function alone (i.e. social media, news media, forum, etc), you'll notice the groupings form in the same way as if you categorized based on layout alone. My reason for not simply sorting by function, however, is that implementation and user flows are much more flexible than layout design, and tend to fluctuate significantly between even these similar websites. Staying within the base-level of layout patterns, I've been able to provide a consistent and accurate taxonomy of web design.

Most websites can be grouped into the following categories.

1. Alpha
2. Beta

These categories can be extended by the component pieces of each. As such:

1. Alpha
   * Alpha alpha
2. Beta
   * Beta beta

This taxonomy provides a method of categorization for future layout patterns and a simple assessment of their most likely function – which is a positive indicator of their best suited purpose.

Layouts form the foundation of design on the web. Over time, they have evolved in tandem with content and web technologies to become more interactive and versatile. Generally speaking, all web services can be grouped by function – i.e. social media, news, forums, email – and within each group there is a dominant technique for the site layout. These dominant techniques form the basis of a growing library of layout patterns.

Layouts are often derived by a site’s content structure (information architecture) and interaction needs (active and passive engagement). We can reverse engineer layouts to extrapolate  functionality and content structure as a proofing method for most deliverables of user experience design, resulting in faster and more diverse iteration.

Today’s layout patterns are responsive and largely homogenous but still developing. By watching the advancement of more established web services, especially online news, we can gain a perspective on the trends of development and speculate on improvements for younger services, like social media.
This project documents the rise of patterns in web layouts in order to better understand the design trajectories of new and existing front end web services.
