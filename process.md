My first approach to analyzing layout design was to research existing design. I decided to study how web design had evolved over the past twenty years, so I wrote a simple bot that crawled the Internet Archive’s WayBack Machine and generated sequential screenshots of any given website. Using these image sequences as individual frames, I created short stop-motion films of web history.

Unfortunately, since older browsers varied significantly from each other, many web developers resorted to only supporting a single browser and used non-standard, vendor-specific code. This hiccup in web development meant that many of the archive’s snapshots from the early ’00s could not be rendered correctly in a 2014 version of webkit.

These films are intriguing. They are representative of so many things: of screen sizes, web standards, proprietary format wars, vendor-specific features, visual trends, industry changes, and more. Significant layout changes are visible and on some of the less active films they are actually very apparent. However, the fluctuant content of most websites makes it difficult to examine them closely.

In order to see these sites’ layouts in a broader, brighter light I needed to simplify the image sequences. Referencing low fidelity wireframes, I outlined several screenshots with simple shapes and lines to test readability. Going from the minimum up, I took note that block-level shapes weren’t descriptive enough to determine the functionality of a site, but adding too many elements that represented more ornamentation than content brought me back to the previous issue of density. I ultimately decided to fill in all advertising spaces, large images, and certain interactable elements with solid colors and to only show lines representing text as headlines, navigation, or similarly emphasized content.

Now that I had a consistent method to discern structural basics from finished products I could start looking more deeply into specific samples. I drew upon my stop-motion films to look for sites across a theme and with large and generally usable archives. It was important that the sites I chose be similar to each other so that I would later be able to make cross-sectional examinations and determine trends reliably.

I found three sites each with close to twenty years’ worth of archives in the WayBack Machine and all in the same field. It is also noteworthy that AOL, MSN, and Yahoo have been heavily invested in over that period of time, ensuring that each update to the site would have been an honest attempt at driving usability and ultimately revenue. The final driving point to choose these three was their prominence in web history. 

AOL is well known for its past as an internet service provider as well as its now-infamous browser (the remnants of Netscape, too). MSN has been an international news source and over time has gained and lost integration with various other Microsoft products, as well as being the default homepage in Internet Explorer, and finally Yahoo, with its early search engine and over half-billion monthly users today, is another internationally known brand.
